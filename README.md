# Weather App #
A simple application using React and the Open Weather API.
Initially based off of Tyler Potts' React repositiory (https://github.com/TylerPottsDev/weather-react), however updated to use SCSS styling and axios for fetching the required data. Application is also refactored to utilize a structured folder structure.

## Steps to run application locally ##
* Download or clone Repository to local machine
* Install dependancies with either `yarn install` or `npm install`
* Register and create an API from the Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/)
* Once an API key is obtained, update the `key` variable inside of the `public/src/utils/staticVariables.js`
* Run application with `yarn start`or `npm start`
